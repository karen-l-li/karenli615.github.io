        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="aboutme">I am orginally from Tulsa, OK. I moved to Norman, OK to pursue higher education at the University of Oklahoma.
         In hopes of combining my love for business and technology, I'm majoring in Management Information Systems. Throughout my years in college, 
         my interests in coding and development grew stronger.As well as being involved in several organizations/clubs such as Lambda Delta Psi, and 
         the MIS Student Association. This is where I have developed majority of my leadership skills.
         In my free time, I run my own small business where I have learned how to bookkeep and manage finances. My dream is to open my own location for my business
         and land a job in software development or data science while living in a big city.</p>
